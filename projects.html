    <h2>Elephant Nature Park- Karen Elephant Sanctuary</h2>

  <div class= "textbox">
    <p>The Elephant Nature Park is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation centre for elephants that have been previously abused. Volunteers are welcomed to their parks located in Thailand and Cambodia to visit, learn about and care for the elephants. Their latest park in Myanmar was set to be open in 2017. </p>

    <p>At the end of February 2017, I went to the Karen Elephant Sanctuary located in Myanmar with 14 classmates for a school project. Our objective in visiting the new sanctuary was to understand and learn more about how the new sanctuary was working together with the Karen villagers to care for the elephants.</p>

    <p>We were tasked to propose ways to increase awareness of the sanctuary and encourage public involvement through voluntourism.</p>

    <p>These are two short videos I have created as part of my  group's  efforts to showcase what the Karen Elephant Sanctuary looks like.</p>
